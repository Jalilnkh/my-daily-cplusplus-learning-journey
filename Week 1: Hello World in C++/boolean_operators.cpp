Equal To & Not Equal To:
Boolean operators are operators that return a boolean value (true or false).
Less Than & Less Than or Equal To
The < operator is used to check if one value is less than another value.
Greater Than & Greater Than or Equal To
The > operator is used to check if one value is greater than another value.
The && Operator
The && (and) operator allows for compound (more than one) boolean expressions.
The || Operator
The || (or) operator allows for compound (more than one) boolean expressions. 
If at least one boolean expression is true, then the whole thing is true. 
The ! Operator
The ! (not) operator produces the opposite result of the boolean expression that it modifies.
Short Circuiting
If C++ can determine the result of a boolean expression before evaluating the entire thing, it will stop and return the value.
