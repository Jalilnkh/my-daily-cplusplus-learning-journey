# Week 1: C++ Basics - Arithmetic, Boolean Logic, Conditionals, and Loops

## Overview

Welcome to **Week 1** of your C++ programming journey! In this week, we will cover essential programming concepts that will serve as the foundation for your C++ development skills. The topics include arithmetic operations, boolean logic, conditional statements, and loops. Each topic is accompanied by practical tasks to help you understand and implement the concepts.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Arithmetic Operations**

Arithmetic operations are fundamental to programming, allowing you to perform calculations and manipulate data. This section focuses on basic arithmetic operations in C++.

- **Task 1: Add Two Variables Together**  
  Learn how to add two numbers and store the result in a variable.

- **Task 2: Printing Floating Point Numbers**  
  Understand how to work with floating-point numbers (decimals) and print them.

- **Task 3: Incrementing Variables**  
  Practice incrementing a variableâ€™s value using `++` or `+=`.

- **Task 4: String Concatenation**  
  Learn how to combine strings using the `+` operator.

- **Task 5: Subtraction**  
  Perform basic subtraction between two variables.

- **Task 6: Division**  
  Learn how to divide numbers and understand integer vs. floating-point division.

- **Task 7: Modulo**  
  Use the modulus operator `%` to get the remainder of division between two numbers.

- **Task 8: Multiplication**  
  Multiply numbers and variables in C++.

- **Task 9: Order of Operations**  
  Understand the precedence of arithmetic operators in complex expressions.

- **Task 10: Type Casting**  
  Learn how to convert one data type into another (e.g., from `float` to `int`) and understand why it's necessary in certain operations.

### 2. **Boolean Logic**

Boolean logic allows you to make decisions in your programs using `true` or `false` values. This section will teach you how to compare values and combine logical statements.

- **Task 1: Equal To & Not Equal To (`==`, `!=`)**  
  Compare two values to check if they are equal or not.

- **Task 2: Less Than (`<`)**  
  Check if one value is less than another.

- **Task 3: Greater Than (`>`)**  
  Check if one value is greater than another.

- **Task 4: The `&&` Operator**  
  Combine two conditions with the `AND` operator (both must be `true`).

- **Task 5: The `||` Operator**  
  Use the `OR` operator to combine conditions (one must be `true`).

- **Task 6: The `!` Operator**  
  Use the `NOT` operator to reverse the truthiness of a condition.

- **Task 7: Short Circuiting**  
  Understand how C++ evaluates expressions with `&&` and `||` and when it stops evaluating (short-circuit behavior).

### 3. **Conditional Statements**

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions based on conditions.

- **Task 1: If Statements**  
  Write conditional `if` statements that execute code only if a certain condition is true.

- **Task 2: Switch Statements**  
  Use a `switch` statement to handle multiple conditions more efficiently than using multiple `if` statements.

---

### 4. **Loops**

Loops allow your code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition or until a certain condition is met.

- **Task 1: For Loop**  
  Write a `for` loop that iterates over a specific range of numbers.

- **Task 2: While Loop**  
  Use a `while` loop to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

- **Task 3: Nested Loops**  
  Practice using loops within loops to perform more complex tasks, such as printing a matrix or patterns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:
- A C++ compiler (such as **g++**, **clang**)
- A text editor or IDE (such as **VS Code**, **CLion**, or **Code::Blocks**)

### How to Compile and Run C++ Programs

To compile and run a C++ file from the terminal, use the following commands (assuming you are using `g++`):

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `.cpp` file is located.
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ```
4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./output
   ```
