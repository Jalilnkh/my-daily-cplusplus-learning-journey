/* 
Functions are composed of two parts, the header and the body.
The function header may contain several keywords to determine the function type. Next is the name of the function.
The function body is the list of actions the function performs. 
All of the code for the function body should be enclosed within curly braces {} and indented as a best practice to show association.
